<h4><u>Career Objectives</u></h4>

<p>I am unsure about my future career choices or paths. My main obhective as of right is to finish my military service at first.</p>

<p>I have started my military service in the Swiss Armed Forces in July 20203 and will be finished wit it in April 2024. My currently designated function is a <b>Strategic Radio Explorer</b>, which I'm very happy about as I love learning new things. After i have served I want to study something related to science or engineering.</p>

<h4><u>Projects</u></h4>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">github</a> to manage my projects, at the moment most of them aren't online because i haven't written clean code or created a README.md file. My aim is to work on them rewrite and learn from my old code and change the visibility to public. My goal is to learn<a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank"> docker </a> and use it for future projects.</p>

<h4><u>Work Experience</u></h4>

<h5>Strategic Radio Explorer, July 2023 -Present</h5>
<p>Currently a full time Strategic Radio Explorer for the <b>Swiss Armed Forces</b>, serving my mandatory military service.</p>

<h5>Kantonsschule August 2019 - June 2023</h5>
<p>After compulsory school I decided to go to school for another four years and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. At first I didn't know what to study, but I was motivated and learned a lot about myself and the world. In the first two years, I studied general humanities and social sciences alongside the basic subjects. In the last two years I had to choose another major, so I decided to pursue further studies in biochemistry. In this subject I learned a lot about anatomy, biotopes, microbiology, organic chemistry and quantum chemistry. During these 4 years I did a two-week internship in the office in the neighboring city. And sometimes I worked at different companies during my holidays.</p>

<h5>Just for Fun</h5>
