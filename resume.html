<h1>Frid0l1n</h1>
<p>Meet Me, a Swiss guy üá®üá≠ and sports enthusiast üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. While rocking my military role as a Strategic Radio Explorer, my heart beats for computers üíª. I'm dreaming of diving into computer science, coding, and digital tech once my service is over. Imagine blending my love for sports and tech to revolutionize the game!  Watch out for this future tech guru!</p>
<br>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>I spent nine years in mandatory school and did four years of college, with a focus on biology and some chemistry. However, what I really wanted to delve into was informatics or computer science. Biology wasn't my true passion; it was more of a choice I made at the time. During college, I participated in experiments and academic activities related to biology and chemistry, but my heart was leaning towards informatics. Now, I'm eager to pursue my true interest in informatics and see where this journey takes me.</p>
<h4>Projects</h4>
<h5>Financial Machine Learning using Random Forest Classifier</h5>
<p>The<a href="https://github.com/Frid0l1n/Random-Forest"> Random Forest Classifier</a> is an attempt of diving into the field of Quantitative Finance. I haven't worked at the project but currently i'm highly motivated to work at it. The programm calculates different indexes and based on them it makes it's decision wheter the stock is riseing in price or falling.</p>
<h6>Key Feautures:</h6>
<li>Stock price prediction using a Random Forest Classifier</li>
<h6>Tech Stack:</h6>
<li>Python for implementing the Prediction Model</li>
<li>Terminal for user input</li>

<h5>Sport Tracker App:</h5>
<p>Due to my interest in sport and coding i'm looking forward to code a simple sport tracker. I haven't any experience in codeing a mobile app but i'm highly motivated to create an opensource and datafriendly mobile app. Underneath a list of tools that could be used for this project.</p>
<h6>Minimum Viable Product:</h6>
<li>Calculate Calories</li>
<li>Creating different trainings and log the sets</li>
<li>Opensource</li>
<h6>Techstack</h6>
<li>Flutter for basic development</li>
<li>Way to save the sets locally and export it to another device</li>
