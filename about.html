    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello there! Glad you're here this means you're interested in knowing more about who I am and what i do. If you're interested in my resume, you can look at it <a href="resume.html">here.</a>If you're interested in my setup take a look at it <a href="setup.html">here</a></p>
    <h4>Identity</h4>
    <p>I'm Frid0l1n I'm currently serving in the <a href="https://www.vtg.admin.ch/de/home.html" target="_blank">Swiss Army</a> as a Strategic Radio Explorer. As you have seen on this website multiple times my username is Krypton. You might ask yourself: "But why this name?". Well the answer is really simple. When i was searching for a username, back in 2019; I was in school and everybody called me Fridolin, so i decided to use it as my username. I really adore this funny name so i have it since that day :)</p>
    <p>My, by far, favourite hobbies are cycling, coding and anything related to travelling.</p>
    <h4>Programming</h4>
    <p>I started coding a few years ago and learned the very Basics of Python but not really serious. Then i took a long breakt of coding it seemed like i wasn't really attracted to it. When i had to write my final work to graduate i've realized how creativ and free you are when you want to do something: which ended up me beeing passionate about it. I kept learning Python and started to use it. Currently im looking forward to learn new languages such as Go, Dart etc. And there I am now a simple soldier looking forward to study computer science at ETH.</p>
    <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
    <p>its hard to estimate the knowledge you have in a language. I tried my best but this probably does not reflect the reality. They're listed based on how I appreciate the languages and the frequency I use them.</p>
    <li><strong>Python:</strong> My first language i've learned by far one of my favourites and moste used ones.</li>
    <li><strong>C++:</strong> My second Programming language i've learned. I don't use it very much but it introduced me into lower level languages.</li>
    <li><strong>C</strong> Another low level language i've tried to learn. I would say i know the very basics wouldn't be really able to code something usefull in C.</li>
    <li><strong>SQL:</strong> I've learned SQL at school and still use it.</li>

    <p>There's pretty much nothing else to say about me, so I'll stop writing here :)</p>
    <p>Hopefully you'll enjoy my future projects and stay in touch with me. Do not hestiate to contact me via <a href="emailto:nicolas_l.widmer@gmx.ch">email</a>, <a href="dicord.com">Discord</a> or whatever you want (<a href="index.html"><em>see "Find me on..."</em></a>) if you have any questions.</p>
    <p>~ Frid0l1n</p>
